**Constructor**
- it is a particular method present under the class responsibilities for initializing the variable of that class.

- the name of the constructor is the same as the class in which it presents.

- non-value returning method does not return any value.

- every class requires this constructor if we want to create the instance of the classes.

- It's the responsibility of the programmer to define a constructor under his class. If he failed to do so, on behalf of the programmer, an implicit constructor gets set in the course by the compiler.
